For using Flexbox we need a div tag 'conatiner', inside it you could set all box 
you need using flex box property, this ways you will avoid to use float left 
property.

The conainer always have the property 'display flex' and does the same thing like it 
you had applyed 'float left'

Flex direction: 
    row - This sets the boxes in a row at the left side from the first box 1|2|3|4
    row-reverse - This sets the boxes in a row at the rigt side from the first box 4|3|2|1
Flex wrap : this respects the size of the box setting the boxes in other line and other column
